  description:
    value: "<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you delve the secrets of the divine, prying into magic usually denied to the arcane paths. Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a spell from the cleric spell list. Any cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a Wizard spell for you and is recorded in your spellbook, but other wizards are unable to copy these spells into their own spellbooks. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and can never be a spell level higher than your proficiency bonus (meaning you will be unable to learn cleric spells of 7th level or higher).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Using arcane magic to recreate divine magic strains your body. You can cast a number of spells gained from this feature equal to your proficiency bonus before these spells cause critical strain to you. You regain all uses when you complete a long rest. When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to reset this limit instead of regain spell slots.</p>\n<p>Using divine magic that restores life strains the body even further, causing you to gain 2 levels of exhaustion when you cast a spell learned through this feature that restores a creature to life.</p>"

      <p>Starting at 14th level, you can build off the success of others and
      encourage them to greater heights. When another creature scores a critical
      strike while within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a
      single weapon attack against the same target. When you deal a critical
      strike or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells by 5
      or more, you can use your reaction to take the Help action to encourage an
      ally to follow up on success.</p><p>You can expend a use of Bardic
      Inspiration to take one of these reactions even when the attack was not a
      critical hit.</p>

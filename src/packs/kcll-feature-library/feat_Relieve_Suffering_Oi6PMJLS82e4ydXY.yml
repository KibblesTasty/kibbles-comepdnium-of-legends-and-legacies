      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher
      that restores hit points, you can expend some of your own hit points to
      increase the amount healed, expending a number of hit points up to your
      Cleric level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can touch a creature suffering a disease or the
      blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned condition and transfer that
      disease or condition to yourself. Starting at 9th level, the range of
      conditions you can take increases, including exhaustion (1 level at a
      time), petrified, stunned, the effect of a curse, or any reduction to
      their ability scores. You are afflicted by the effect in the same manner
      the creature you took it was, for the same duration and possible methods
      of ending the effect.</p>

      <p>You can do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier,
      regaining all uses on a long rest.</p>

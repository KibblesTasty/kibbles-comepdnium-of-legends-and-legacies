    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, as an action you can present your holy symbol
      and invoke judgment upon your enemies. You crush a target within 60 feet
      under the weight of their sins. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On
      failure, the creature is knocked prone and their movement speed is dropped
      to zero for 1 minute. The creature can repeat their saving throw at the
      end of each of their turns. They make this save disadvantage if they have
      dealt damage since the start of their turn.</p>

      <p>You can apply the bonus damage of Sacred Judgement when dealing damage
      with a Cleric spell to a creature you have Invoked Judgement on regardless
      if they have damaged another creature. This persists for 1 minute
      regardless of their save.</p>

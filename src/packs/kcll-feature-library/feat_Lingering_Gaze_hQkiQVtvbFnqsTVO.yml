      <p>At 6th level, when you invoke your Patron's Gaze, the spectral eye
      lasts for 1 minute of before fading away, and you use your bonus action on
      each of turns to cause it to fire again, rolling on the table anew. Once
      during the duration of each eye, you can pick the effect it fires instead
      of rolling.</p><p>While you have the spectral eye with you, have advantage
      on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can perform the Search action as a bonus
      action (instead of firing an eye ray).</p>

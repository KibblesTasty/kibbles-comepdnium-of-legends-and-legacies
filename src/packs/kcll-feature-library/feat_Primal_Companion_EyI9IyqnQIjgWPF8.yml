      <p>Starting at 2nd level when you join this circle, you form a bond with a
      beast spirit and can allow it to take form by expending a use of your
      Wildshape. Its statblock becomes that of your Beast Companion, applying
      the modifications from the customization table that best fit the form it
      takes. At the GM's discretion, custom abilities can replace those powers
      to better represent the beast companion. Once selected, the traits cannot
      be changed, as the beasts spirit takes on that form permanently.</p><p>The
      beast's soul becomes entangled with your own, granting you the ability to
      call it forth from wherever it is, and even return it to life should it
      ever fall, by expending a use of your Wildshape ability. You can expend a
      use of Wildshape to call it to an empty space within 10 feet of you, where
      it appears at full hit points, and free of any conditions or spells that
      were affecting it. You can cause it to return to its spirit form as a
      bonus action, but must expend a use of Wildshape to call it forth once
      more after doing so.</p><p>In combat, the Beast Companion shares your
      initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only
      action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus
      action on your turn to command it to take another action. You can command
      your Beast Companion as part of the same bonus action used to summon it.
      That action can be the one in its stat block or some other action. If you
      are incapacitated, the Beast Spirit can take an take any action of its
      choice, not just Dodge.</p><p>When you manifest the beast, it lasts until
      you complete a long rest (unless you expend a use of Wildshape to keep it
      manifested), it is reduced to zero hit points, or you die, at which point
      it vanishes, fading away until you expend a use of Wildshape to call it
      forth again.</p><blockquote><h3>Spirit Animal</h3><p>At your GM's
      discretion, you can form a bond with a normal willing animal, its
      statblock getting replaced with the Beast Companion statblock, with
      customizations selected to best represent its original stats. It gains all
      the same properties as a Primal Companion, it's soul becoming entangled
      with your own, and it becomes a spirit beast.</p><h3>Form
      Permanency</h3><p>This rule is to prevent having to rebuild the stat block
      and save time, as well as a balance consideration, but at the GM's
      discretion they can allow it to be changed to a new permanent form if
      there is a good reason.</p></blockquote>

      <p>As part of your study of magic, you gain the ability to cast spells at
      2nd level. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned
      with enhancing your abilities and devastating your foes.</p>

      <h2>Cantrips</h2>

      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Spellblade
      spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher
      levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table</p>

      <h2>Spell Slots</h2>

      <p>The Spellblade table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      Spellblade spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of your Spellblade
      spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
      all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h2>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h2>

      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Spellblade
      spell list. The Spells Known column of the Spellblade table shows when you
      learn more Spellblade spells of your choice.</p>

      <p>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
      For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one
      new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the Spellblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the Spellblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
      have spell slots.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your
      proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Focus</h2>

      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Spellblade
      spells. See chapter 5, "Equipment" in the Playerâ€™s Handbook for various
      arcane focus options.</p>

      <p>Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus action you can unveil the void's
      reflection within your eyes for 1 minute. When you unleash this power and
      as a bonus action on each of your turns for 1 minute, you can direct this
      power at a creature within 60 feet, with an effect depending on your
      Eschatological Conclusion selection.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Conclusion of
      Annihilation.</strong> Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target
      takes 1d8 force

      Madness.</strong> The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your
      spell save DC. On failure, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and the
      first attack against them before the start of your next turn has
      advantage.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feature-library.Item.Ep1rcS1dj3jPIAnj]{Void

      active, you gain the ability to see through both natural and magical
      darkness as if it were bright light for a range of 60 feet, and are immune
      to the blinded condition.</p><p>You can use this power a number of times
      equal to your Wisdom modifier, but each time you use it again before
      completing a short rest you must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On
      failure, you become blinded until you complete a short or long rest. While
      blinded in this way, you have a blindsight of 10 feet. You regain all uses
      of the feature on a long rest.</p>

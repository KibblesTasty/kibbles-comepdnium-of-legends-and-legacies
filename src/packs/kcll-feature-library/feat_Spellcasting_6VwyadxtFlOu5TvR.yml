    value: "<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h3><strong>Spell Slots</strong></h3>\n<p>The Crusader Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h3><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</strong></h3>\n<p>You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice from the cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>The Spells Known column of the Crusader Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h3>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you learn your spells through faith and conviction. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>"

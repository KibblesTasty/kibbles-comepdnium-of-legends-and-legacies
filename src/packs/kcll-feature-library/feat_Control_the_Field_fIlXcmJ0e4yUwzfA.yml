      <p>Starting at 7th level, when you use an ability that moves allied
      creatures (such as Urgent Orders or Shift the Field), it gains the
      following properties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Deceptive Movement: </strong>You can attempt to move creatures
      that are not allies up to 5 feet (or half their movement speed, whichever
      is less). The creature must make an Intelligence Saving Throw with a DC of
      8 + your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency bonus, or feel compelled
      to move to the new position immediately. Targets moved this way do not
      gain temporary hit points.</li>

      <li><strong>Flanking Maneuvers:</strong> If two allies you move are on
      opposite sides of a creature after the movement you grant, the first one
      to attack that enemy has advantage on their first attack if they attack
      before the creature moves.</li>

      <li><strong>Coordinated Transitions:</strong> Allies can move through each
      other's spaces during the movement you grant without it being difficult
      terrain.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Additionally at 2nd level, you start to form a magical Aegis that
      enhances your physical powers with magical powers, blending them together.
      You can select one 1st level slot Aegis effect (listed at the end of the
      class) and gain the effects.</p><p>When you complete a long rest, you can
      change your selected 1st level slot Aegis effect or further boost your
      Aegis by sacrificing spell slots, granting magical empowerments that last
      until you complete your next long rest. When you do so, select an
      additional Aegis Effect (listed at the end of the class document) and
      expend the listed level of spell slot.</p><p>You can expend a maximum
      number of spell slot levels this way equal to your Spellblade level
      divided by four (rounded up, for example, at 5th level you can expend two
      levels of spell slots this way, while at 9th level you can expend three
      levels of spell slot, etc.).</p>

    value: >-
      <p>At 20th level, you can use your primal connection with the natural
      powers of the world to reshape the land around you on a large scale. This
      can take the form of effects like earthquake, tsunami, control weather, or
      transmutation or conjuration spell from the Druid spell list that modifies
      the terrain (such as wall of stone).</p>

      <p>At the GM's discretion, this might be used to accomplish other large
      scale feats not listed by a spell, such as changing the course of a river,
      quenching a forest fire, or causing an active volcano to have a small
      eruption. Its range effect should generally be contained with a 1 mile
      radius area when not replicating the spells listed above.</p>

      <p>Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you complete a long
      rest.</p>

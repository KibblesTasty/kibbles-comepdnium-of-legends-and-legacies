      <p>Starting at 11th level, when a creature you have marked with Dead or
      Alive or moves 5 feet, stands up from being prone, or escapes from the
      Restrained condition while within 60 feet of you, you can use your
      reaction to make an opportunity attack against them if they are in range
      of a weapon you are wielding. If you make this attack with a ranged
      weapon, you have disadvantage on the attack.</p>

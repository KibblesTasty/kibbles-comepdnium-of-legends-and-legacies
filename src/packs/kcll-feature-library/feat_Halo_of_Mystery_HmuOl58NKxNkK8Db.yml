    value: >-
      <p>When you roll initiative or as a bonus action at any time, you can
      invoke the power of a mystery you know, causing its power to swirl around
      you forming a halo. This halo lasts until you invoke another Mystery this
      way, or dismiss it as a bonus action. Itâ€™s effect depends on the Mystery
      Invoked.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Darkness</strong>. You shrouded in darkness
      and difficult to make out. You have half cover against attacks and are
      considered to be in dim light regardless of the surrounding
      light.</p></li><li><p><strong>Death</strong>. You gain resistance to
      necrotic damage. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can make a Wisdom
      saving throw with a DC of 10 + the damage taken to be reduced to 1 hit
      point instead on success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fire</strong>. You shed
      bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
      You gain resistance to fire damage, and immunity to the fire damage of
      your own spells.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life</strong>. When you restore
      hit points to another creature, they gain temporary hit points equal to
      half the hit points restored.</p></li><li><p><strong>Light</strong>. You
      shed bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
      feet (this light interacts with Truth of Light if you have that Rite). You
      gain resistance to radiant damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nature</strong>.
      You become surrounded by thorny vines. Any creature that strikes you with
      a melee weapon attack takes 1d8 piercing
      damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Souls</strong>. You become ghostly and
      translucent, gaining a flying speed of 20 feet and can pass through
      objects less than a foot thick, as well as through creatures, and ignore
      all difficult terrain.</p></li><li><p><strong>War</strong>. When you take
      damage, you can subtract your Wisdom modifier from the damage taken
      (reducing it to a minimum of 1).</p></li></ul>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, when you cast find familiar, your familiar gains an
      Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma of 10, and the ability to speak any
      languages you speak.</p>

      <h2>Black Coven</h2>

      <p>As a reaction to a creature within 30 feet of your familiar hitting
      with an attack, you can have your familiar subtract 1d4 + half your
      Occultist level (rounded down) from the attack roll. You can choose to use
      this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM
      determines whether the attack roll succeeds or fails, or before the
      creature deals its damage. It can do this a number of times equal to your
      Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses after you complete a long rest.</p>

      <p>@Item[h3hquxusFb3lMwXd]{Familiar Bond: Black Coven}</p>

      <h2>White Coven</h2>

      <p>When you complete a long rest, your familiar gains temporary hit points
      equal to your Wisdom modifier + your twice Occultist level. While it has
      one or more temporary hit points, as its action, or as a reaction to a
      creature within 30 feet of it taking damage, it can teleport to allied
      targets giving that target some of its temporary hit points (minimum
      one).</p>

      <p>@Item[l40YqRo0zfs1YViE]{Familiar Bond: White Coven}</p>

      <h2>Green Coven</h2>

      <p>When you complete a long rest, your familiar gains illusory duplicates
      equal to your Wisdom modifier. These persist until destroyed by taking
      damage or you complete a long rest. The illusory duplicates cannot take
      any actions, but move and act like your familiar during your turn, staying
      within 30 feet of you or it.</p>

      <p>At the end of your familiar's turn or when it takes damage, it can swap
      places with an illusory familiar. If it does this as a result of taking
      damage, the illusory familiar is destroyed but the familiar takes no
      damage. Illusory duplicates are immune to damage while within 5 feet of
      you.</p>

      <p>You can assume illusory familiars are in the witch's space unless
      otherwise specified.</p>

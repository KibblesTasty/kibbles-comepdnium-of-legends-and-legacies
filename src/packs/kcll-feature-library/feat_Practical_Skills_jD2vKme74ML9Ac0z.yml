      <p>You gain proficiency in your choice of one of the following skills:
      Arcana, Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Additionally you
      can select 1 additional cantrips of your choice from the occultist list,
      or from the following expanded cantrip spell list: blade ward, firebolt ,
      mage hand, prestidigitation, friends, ray of frost, shillelagh, spare the
      dying, thaumaturgy, true strike. When you learn a new cantrip, you can
      select from the above expanded list in addition to the Occultst list.</p>

      <p>You learn your magic through self-discovery, often encompassing trial
      and error. Not knowing what is supposed to be impossible or impractical,
      your magic develops unique aspects. You can modify spells you learn with
      the following feature.</p>

      <h2>The Way I Learned It</h2>

      <p>When you learn a new spell, you can modify some its properties
      representing your unique way of casting that spell. These changes
      permanently effect the spell for you, but when you swap out a spell when
      gaining a level in the class, you can instead modify these properties from
      a spell you know. You can learn the same spell multiple times with
      different selections (i.e. "ranged cure wounds")</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Damage Type.</strong> You can change any of the following
      damage types into another the damage types. Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning,
      Poison.</li>

      <li><strong>Range.</strong> You can make a spell with a range of 10 feet
      or more have a range of Touch, or give a spell with a range of Touch a
      range of up 10 feet (if it was a melee spell attack and it becomes a
      ranged spell attack if the range is greater than Touch).</li>

      <li><strong>Components.</strong> You can exchange a verbal, somatic, or
      material component of a spell for another type of component the spell does
      not normally have. Material components with a cost cannot be replaced, but
      can be exchanged for a different material component of equal cost.</li>

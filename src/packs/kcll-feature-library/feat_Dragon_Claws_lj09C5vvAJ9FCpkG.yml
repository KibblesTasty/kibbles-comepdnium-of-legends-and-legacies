      Claws</h3>

      <p><em>Prerequisite: Dragon patron, Pact of the Blade, Incompatible with
      Improved Pact Weapon</em></p>

      <p>As an action, you can grow draconic claws on one or both hands, lasting
      until you dismiss them as an action.</p>

      <p>This claws count as your pact weapon. While the claws are formed, you
      cannot use a weapon or shield in the hand they are manifested in. These
      are natural weapons that deal 1d6 slashing damage. When you form claws in
      both hands, if you make an attack with your claws, you can make one
      additional weapon attack with them as a bonus action. When you attack with
      your claws, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or
      Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</p>

      <p>In addition, the claws gain a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls.
      These benefits (Charisma, attack and damage bonus, and counting the
      natural weapons as your pact weapon) also applies to any natural weapons
      you gain through the Dragon Subclass (such as Dragon Form). You can
      sacrifice a martial weapon with a bonus greater than +1 to attack and
      damage rolls to your patron, permanently destroying it. When you do so,
      the bonus to attack and damage rolls of your claws increases to that of
      the sacrificed weapon. Your DM has the final say of which weapons can be
      sacrificed in this way, and if any other properties are gained from the
      ritual.</p>

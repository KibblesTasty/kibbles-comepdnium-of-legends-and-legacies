      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can physically enter dreams to travel, gain
      information, or influence them. When you fall asleep or as an action while
      awake, you can enter the ethereal realm of dreams for up to an hour. You
      can exit the realm of dreams as a bonus action. You can only exit the
      realm of dreams within 120 feet of where you entered, or within 5 feet of
      a sleeping creature. While in the realm of dreams, you can do any of the
      following:</p><ul><li><p>Teleport to a location you've been to before or a
      person you are familiar with (though you can only exit the dream realm
      there if there is a sleeping person to use as a
      conduit).</p></li><li><p>Cast the dream spell once without expending a
      spell slot, after which you cannot do so again until next you enter the
      dream realm.</p></li><li><p>Search for information from the dreams of
      others, making a Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC based on the difficulty
      of finding the information, or contested by a Deception check using
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by the target if you are trying to
      acquire it from a specific target (their choice of which). If you fail a
      check to acquire a piece of information, you cannot attempt to
      again.</p></li></ul><p>You can enter the dream realm in this way once,
      after which you must complete a long rest before doing so again.</p>

      <p>Starting at 17th level, as an action, you can cause a tree to sprout
      from the ground at a point within 30 feet of you that morphs into a
      tree-like-clone of you. It shares all of your statistics and abilities,
      and is under your control, but has its own actions. It is under your
      control, and acts immediately after you in initiative.</p>

      <p>It has hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. It is in Tree
      Form, and cannot end the effect of that ability. It lasts for 1 minute, or
      until it is reduced to 0 hit points. If you die while it exists, you
      become the tree clone, after which you can end the Tree Form as
      normal.</p>

      <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a
      long rest.</p>

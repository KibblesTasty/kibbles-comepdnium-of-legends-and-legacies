    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your power to morph and adapt heavy
      armor you are wearing. As an action, you can reconfigure your armor,
      selecting one of the following options.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Reinforced
      Carapace.</strong> Your armor AC while wearing heavy armor increases by
      1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regenerating Carapace.</strong> At the end of
      each of your turns, you restore any damage it has taken, restoring its
      original AC value. Any pieces that have been removed before regeneration
      rust away to nothing. If you are wearing no armor, you can use this
      feature to create a set of common heavy armor (which is automatically
      equipped). Armor created this way rusts away to nothing when
      removed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spiked Carapace.</strong> When a creature
      hits you with a melee weapon attack while within 5 feet or attempts to
      grapple you, they take [[/r 1d4]] piercing damage. The damage increases to
      2d4 when you reach 14th level.</p></li></ul><p>The effect lasts until you
      select another effect, or end the effect as a bonus action.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can transform one or both arms into durable forms of living
      stone. You cannot wield weapons or shields in hands that you have turned
      to stone, but they can be used to grapple creatures.</p>

      <p>While you are grappling a creature with your stone fists, that fist can
      only attack that creature. The stone form lasts until you dismiss them as
      a bonus action.</p>

      <h2>Stone Fist</h2>

      <p>A hardened limb of stone. This becomes a natural one handed melee
      weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on hit, and has the Light and
      Special properties.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You gain +1 to your AC while wielding one of
      these weapons in each hand.</p>

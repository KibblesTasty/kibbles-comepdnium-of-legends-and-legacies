    value: >-
      <p>You make a ward against supernatural harm. While you wear this charm,
      you can use it to cast protection from evil and good without expending a
      spell slot, material components, or requiring concentration, but the spell
      lasts a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can cast this
      as a reaction to being attacked or making a save it would affect, but when
      you do so it only lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><p>Once you
      use this charm, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long
      rest.</p>

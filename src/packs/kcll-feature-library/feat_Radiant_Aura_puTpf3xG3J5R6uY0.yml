      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, your Primal Interdiction is filled with
      bright light, and it casts dim light for an additional radius equal to the
      radius of your Primal Interdiction. This light is difficult to quench, and
      counts as a spell equal to half your Warden level (rounded down) for the
      purposes of countering magical darkness. You can dim, extinguish, or
      relight this light at any time, no action required.</p><p>Creatures inside
      your Primal Interdiction remain comfortably warm, ignoring the effects of
      cold weather, or heat caused by the sun (though other sources of heat may
      still cause discomfort, such as lava). You and all friendly creatures
      within range of Primal Interdiction can apply the damage reduction of your
      Mystic Bulwark to cold and necrotic damage.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you hit a creature with an attack or it
      fails a saving throw against one of your spells, you can afflict them with
      a malignant spirit. This spirit haunts them for 1 minute, and while it
      persists any time the creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or
      ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the spirit hindering
      them to bring them misfortune. Roll a d6 spirit die and subtract it from
      the result of their roll. You can do this after they roll, but before the
      outcome is determined.</p><p>The spirit can be removed by effects that
      remove or prevent possession (such as protection from evil and good), or
      the target can attempt to rid itself of the spirit as an action, making a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, removing the spirit and
      ending the effect on success).</p><p>The size of the spirit die increases
      at 5th level (to a d8), 11th level (to a d10), and 17th level (to a d12).
      Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a
      short or long rest.</p>

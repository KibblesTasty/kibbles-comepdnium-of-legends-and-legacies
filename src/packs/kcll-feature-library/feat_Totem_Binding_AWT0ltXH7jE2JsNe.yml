      <p>Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can create a totem of power at
      a point within 15 feet of you. You learn two totems when you gain this
      feature, and another totem at 5th level (3), 11th level (4), and 17th
      level (5). The following are the list of totems you can
      select:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Agonizing Totem.</strong> Any creature of
      your choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of the totem or enters
      within 10 feet of it for the first time on their turn takes 1d6 necrotic
      damage. Any creature that damages the totem from within 10 feet of it
      takes 1d6 necrotic damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Binding Totem.</strong>
      Terrain within 10 feet of the totem is difficult terrain for creatures of
      your choice, and any creature attempting to teleport into or out of the
      radius must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or
      the attempt fails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grappling Totem.</strong> When
      you create the totem, it attempts to bind a Large or smaller creature of
      your choice within 10 feet, forcing them to make a Dexterity saving throw
      against your spell save DC. On failure, they are pulled to within 5 feet
      of the totem and grappled by it (escape DC equals your spell save DC).
      This totem cannot be made mobile by other effects or
      features.</p></li><li><p><strong>Life Totem.</strong> When a creature
      starts its turn within 10 feet of the totem you can heal them with the
      totem for 1d6 hit points. The totem does this a number of times equal to
      your Wisdom modifier, after which its power fades and it
      crumbles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sanctuary Totem.</strong> All creatures
      of your choice within 10 feet of the totem are under the effect of
      sanctuary. This effect is broken under the normal conditions of sanctuary
      and cannot be regained from a totem for 1 minute once
      lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shrouding Totem.</strong> All creatures and
      objects (including the totem) within 10 feet of the totem are lightly
      obscured from creatures beyond 10 feet of the totem, and gain the benefits
      of half cover against ranged attack rolls originating from outside the
      Totemâ€™s radius.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soothing Totem.</strong> All
      creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the totem have advantage on
      saving throws against being Charmed or
      Frightened.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warding Totem.</strong> All creatures
      of your choice within 10 feet of the totem gain resistance to all damage,
      but the totem takes damage equal to the damage taken by creatures that
      benefit from the resistance (which can destroy the totem, ending the
      effect).</p></li></ul><p>A totem is a Small sized object with an AC of 12
      and hit points equal to your occultist level. If it is reduced to 0 hit
      points, it is destroyed and its effect ends. A creature cannot be affected
      by more than one of the same type of totem at the same time. A totem
      cannot be moved once placed. Totems can last a maximum of 1 minute, after
      which they lose power and crumble away. You can place a number of totems
      equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses when you complete a long
      rest.</p>

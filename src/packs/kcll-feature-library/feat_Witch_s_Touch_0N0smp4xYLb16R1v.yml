    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell with a range of touch
      (including through your familiar), you can add one of the following
      modifiers to the spell:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>It grants one affected target temporary hit points equal to your
      Wisdom modifier. Only one creature can have these temporary hit points at
      a time.</li>

      <li>It deals additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier to one
      affected creature.</li>

      <li>It adds or subtracts 1d4 from the target's next attack roll or saving
      throw before the start of your next turn.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can also confer these effects to another spell with a range longer
      than touch by making its range touch, or confer these effects as an action
      without casting a spell by touching a target (making a melee spell attack
      to do if the target is an unwilling creature). If you make the range of a
      curse spell touch, you no longer need the material component for the
      spell.</p>

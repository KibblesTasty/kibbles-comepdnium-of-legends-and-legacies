      <p>At 3rd level, you can add your Rage bonus damage to damage rolls made
      with thrown weapons, as well as use your Reckless Attack feature when you
      make a ranged weapon attack with a light melee weapon. Additionally, being
      within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your
      ranged weapon attack rolls.</p>

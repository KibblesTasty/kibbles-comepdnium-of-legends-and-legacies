      <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you can select a technique to specialize in
      for using your totems, granting you a bonus to them. Select one of the
      following when you gain this feature:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dancing
      Totems.</strong> Instead of placing your totems at a point, you can summon
      your totems as Tiny sized mobile objects that orbit you in your space and
      emit their effects from your space. The totems can still be targeted and
      destroyed individually.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sturdy Totems.</strong>
      Your totems add your proficiency bonus to their AC and have hit points
      equal to twice your Occultist level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Swift
      Totems.</strong> You can place a totem as a bonus action instead of an
      action.</p></li></ul>

    value: >-
      <p>If you have a familiar without a flying speed, as an action you can
      make them become a creature one size larger than you (up to Large sized)
      for 8 hours. As an action, you can revert your familiar to its normal
      size. At 12th level, you can use this ability to become familiar with
      flying speed. Once you do this, you cannot do so again until you complete
      a short or long rest. Your familiar's strength becomes 10 while enlarged,
      if it was not already higher.</p>

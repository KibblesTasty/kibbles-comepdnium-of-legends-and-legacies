    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, as an action you can manifest parts of your
      dreams into the real world as fleeting creations within a 20-foot cube
      within 30 feet of you. You can create an object (such as a chair or bed),
      structure (such as a small empty house, a bridge, or stairs), or creature
      this way, but whatever is created must fit within a 20-foot cube.
      Creatures created this way are illusionary, behaving as per the major
      image spell, but objects and effects can be made real with the following
      limitations:</p><ul><li><p>Objects and structures created this way are
      obviously magical in nature and crumble to nothing after 1
      minute.</p></li><li><p>They have no value, and cannot be moved outside of
      the 20-foot.</p></li><li><p>They cannot contain any information you don't
      yourself know (a book on a subject you don't know would be blank for
      example).</p></li><li><p>Objects created this way have an AC equal to your
      Cleric level and crumble to dust if they take damage. They cannot deal any
      damage, crumbling to dust if they would deal damage.</p></li></ul><p>Once
      you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long
      rest, though you can use it again early by expending a 3rd level spell
      slot.</p>

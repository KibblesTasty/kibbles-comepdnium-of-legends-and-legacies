      <p>As a practitioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed
      techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits,
      elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting
      and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</p>

      <h2>Cantrips</h2>

      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist
      spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at
      higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist
      table.</p>

      <h2>Spell Slots</h2>

      <p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell witchbolt and have a
      1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast witchbolt
      using either slot.</p>

      <h2>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h2>

      <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Occultist spell
      list.</p>

      <p>The Spells Known column of the Occultist table shows when you learn
      more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance,
      when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
      or 2nd level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the Occultist spells you know and replace it with another spell from
      the Occultist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots.</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>

      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Occultist spells. Your
      magic comes from a practitioner's knowledge of tradition, ritual, and the
      way things work learned through experience, care and cunning. You use your
      Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
      you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an
      Occultist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier.</p>

      <h2>Ritual Casting</h2>

      <p>You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has
      the ritual tag.</p>

      <h2>Spellcasting Focus</h2>

      <p>You can use an occult fetish as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist
      spells.</p>

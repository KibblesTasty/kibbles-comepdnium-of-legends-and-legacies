  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, when allowing a controlled mount to take an
      action, it can take a multiattack action if it has one. If the Steed does
      not have a multiattack action, it gains one, allowing it to use an
      combination of two of its actions (if it has multiple actions), or take
      its lowest damage attack twice.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can infuse spells into your weapon. When you
      cast a 1st level or higher Swordmage spell with a casting time of 1
      action, you can infuse it into a melee weapon as a bonus action. The next
      time you make an attack with that weapon before the end of your turn, the
      spell is cast against the target.</p>

      <p>If the spell requires an attack roll (melee or ranged) it automatically
      hits the target if the attack hits and misses the target if the attack
      misses. If the spell has a saving throw, it automatically deals damage as
      if they failed saving throw on hit, but if it has any effects besides
      dealing damage, the target makes the save against those effects as normal
      for being targeted by the spell (regardless if the attack hits or misses).
      If a spell does half damage to targets that pass their save, they take
      half damage on a missed attack, treating it as if they had passed their
      saving throw.</p>

      <p>If the spell has an area of effect, that area of effect is triggered
      from the target's space (for example, a cone spell would hit the target as
      part of the attack, and then cast the cone area behind them, while a
      radius spell would be centered on the target, casting the area of effect
      around them with them at the center). Other creatures caught in the area
      of effect treat the spell as if you had cast it normally. The target is
      not affected by the spell again (having already resolved as part of the
      attack).</p>

      <p>Spells that have multiple attack rolls (such as <em>scorching ray
      </em>or <em>crackle</em>) tie the outcome of only the first attack roll to
      the melee weapon attack. You resolve all subsequent attack rolls of the
      spell as if you had cast the spell, but can ignore the disadvantage on
      ranged attack rolls from being within 5 feet of hostile creatures.</p>

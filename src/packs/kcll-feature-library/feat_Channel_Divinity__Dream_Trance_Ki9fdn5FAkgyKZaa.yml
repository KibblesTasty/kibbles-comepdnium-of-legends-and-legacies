      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to pull a
      creature's mind into dreaming trance.</p><p>As an action, you present your
      holy symbol and choose a creature within 60 feet, attempting to pull their
      mind into the dreamscape for up to 10 minutes. An unwilling creature can
      make a Wisdom saving throw, preventing the effect on a successful save. If
      they fail and become ensnared, they can repeat their saving throw at the
      end of each of their turns, escaping the trance on a success.</p><p>While
      their mind is in the dreamscape, the creature is incapacitated, blinded,
      and deafened to the real world.</p><p>As a bonus action, can guide the
      dreams an affected creature, ending the effect and causing one of the
      following conditions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Terrifying Visions.</strong>
      The creature takes 4 times your Cleric level psychic damage and becomes
      frightened of you until the start of your next
      turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tranquil Visions.</strong> Any charmed or
      frightened condition on the creature is ended, and they gain temporary hit
      points equal to 4 times your cleric level, waking at the end of their next
      turn.</p></li></ul><p>Creatures that are already asleep automatically fail
      their initial saving throw against this effect. A creature that takes
      damage is broken out of their dream trance, ending the effect. A creature
      that cannot be charmed automatically passes their saving throw against
      this ability.</p>

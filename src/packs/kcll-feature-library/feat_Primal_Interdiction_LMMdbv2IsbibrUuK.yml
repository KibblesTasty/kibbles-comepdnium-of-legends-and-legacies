      <p>Starting at 2nd level, nature hinders your foes with aspects of your
      primal power. This effect has a 5 foot radius centered on you, turning the
      ground within range into difficult terrain for creatures of your
      choice.</p><p>Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can choose to
      recklessly defend your allies within this area at the cost of your own
      safety, giving attacks against you advantage, and giving attacks against
      allies within the effect disadvantage if you are also in range of the
      attack being made (or have been at any point since the start of the
      attacker's turn) and not behind total cover.</p><p>The range of this
      effect increases by 5 feet at 5th level (to 10 feet), and again at 11th
      level (to 15 feet), and 17th level (to 20 feet).</p>

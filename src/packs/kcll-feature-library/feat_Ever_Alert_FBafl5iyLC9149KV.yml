      <p>Starting at 14th level, the doggo can no longer be surprised, even
      while sleeping. It gains a +5 bonus to initiative rolls, and other
      creatures cannot gain advantage against the doggo as a result of being
      unseen by it. It can still make perception checks and use passive
      perception while sleeping, though it suffers disadvantage on them.</p>

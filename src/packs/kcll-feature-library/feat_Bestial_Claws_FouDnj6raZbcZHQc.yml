    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you roll initiative or as a bonus action at
      any time, you can manifest one or both of your arms into clawed natural
      weapons. You cannot wield weapons or shields in hands that you have
      morphed, but they can be used to grapple creatures. While you are
      grappling a creature with a claw, that claw can only attack that creature.
      The claws last until you dismiss them as a bonus action.</p>

      <h2>Bestial Claws</h2>

      <p>A vicious set of claws extending from one of your hands. This becomes a
      natural one handed melee weapon that deals 1d8 slashing damage on hit, and
      has the Light and Special properties.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This weapon counts as a free hand for the
      purposes of grappling. When you succeed a grapple check with it, the
      target takes 1d6 slashing damage.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, or as an action at
      any time, you can explode into fire, dealing 8d6 fire damage to all
      creatures within a 30 foot radius and being temporarily reborn as a
      phoenix. You can apply Rejuvenating Flames to this fire damage without
      expending a use of the feature or sorcery points.</p><p>You assume the
      form of a Fire Elemental as if by the shapechange spell. This form has the
      following modification: you gain a flying speed of 60 feet, gain the Flyby
      feature (meaning your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity
      when you fly out of an enemy's reach), you add your Charisma modifier
      (minimum +1) to all attack and damage rolls with your Touch attack, and
      can understand and speak any languages you can normally speak. It does not
      require concentration, and you cannot change your form as an action. You
      return to your normal form after 1 hour, or you can end the effect early
      as an action.</p><p>Once you have assumed this form, you cannot assume it
      again until you complete a long rest.</p>

      <p>Starting at 1st level, you can cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{Light} spell. Wisdom is
      your spellcasting modifier for it. If you cast light on a simple melee
      weapon you are wielding, the spell lasts as long as the weapon remains in
      your possession, and the weapon deals fire or radiant damage (your choice)
      instead of its normal damage type. The damage of a weapon under this
      effect is increased by Warden abilities that increase the damage of your
      natural weapons.</p>

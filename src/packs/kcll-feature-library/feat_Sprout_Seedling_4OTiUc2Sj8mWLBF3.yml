      Seedling</h3>

      <p>Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can expend one use of
      your Wild Shape feature to sprout a sapling, rather than assuming a beast
      form. The Seedling to sprouts to life in an empty space you can see within
      30 feet. The Seedling is friendly to you and your companions and obeys
      your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Seedling stat
      block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>

      <p>In combat, the Seedling shares your initiative count, but it takes its
      turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the
      Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to
      take another action. You can command your sapling as part of the same
      bonus action used to summon it. That action can be one in its stat block
      or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the Seedling can take any
      action of its choice, not just Dodge. When you cast a spell with a range
      other than self, the spell can originate from you or your Seedling.</p>

      <p>The Seedling manifests for 10 minutes, until it is reduced to 0 hit
      points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until
      you die.</p>

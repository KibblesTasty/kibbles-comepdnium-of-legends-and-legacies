      Form</h3>

      <p>Starting at 14th level, as an action you can take a form reminiscent of
      your patron, becoming a dragon for 1 minute. You grow mighty horns, thick
      scales, wings, wicked claws, fangs, and a lashing tail. Any creatures of
      your choice within 30 feet that witnesses the transformation must make a
      Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or become frightened until
      the start of your next turn. While in this form, you gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You are a large sized creature. Any gear you cannot use as a large
      draconic creature merges with your form and is unavailable until the
      transformation ends.</li>

      <li>Your Strength becomes equal to your Charisma.</li>

      <li>Your scales provide a base AC of 17. You do not add your Dexterity
      modifier to this.</li>

      <li>Your horns, fangs, and a tail that serve as natural weapons that deal
      1d10 piercing damage on hit. You also grow claws that deal 1d6 slashing
      damage on hit. If you attack with any natural weapon, you can attack with
      your claws as a bonus action.</li>

      <li>The damage of your Draconic Blasts increases by 1 die, and it's range
      is doubled.</li>

      <li>You have a flying speed of 40 feet per turn.</li>

      <li>You gain immunity to the damage type selected for your Dragon
      Blast.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you have used this ability, you may not use it again until you
      complete a long rest.</p>

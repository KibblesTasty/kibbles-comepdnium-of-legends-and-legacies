    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action you can call a spirit to your
      side. This can be a primal spirit of fire, cold, or lightning, or an
      ancestral spirit with radiant or necrotic power. This bond lasts for 10
      minutes once formed. You can release a spirit early as an action, and it
      is immediately released if you call another spirit.</p>

      <p>While a spirit is bonded to you it strengthens your melee weapon
      attacks, causing them to deal an additional [[/r 1d4]] damage of the
      spirit's type.</p>

      <p>As a bonus action while it is bonded, you can manifest the spirit
      within 30 feet of you. The spirit is medium sized but spectral in nature
      while manifested. While the spirit is manifested, whenever you take the
      attack action you may replace any number of attacks you could normally
      take with melee spell attacks from your bonded spirit. Melee spell attacks
      done by the spirit deal [[/r 1d4]] + your Wisdom modifier damage of the
      same spirit's type on a hit. As a bonus action you can move it up to 30
      feet in any direction or recall it to yourself, ending its
      manifestation.</p>

      <p>A manifested spirit cannot move more than 60 feet from you, and is
      recalled to you if you move more than 60 feet from it.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You gain the ability to record and cast ritual spells, selecting one
      class that has ritual casting. You learn two ritual spells from that class
      spell list, and can record new ritual spells from that book that you come
      across in written form. Recording a spell takes 2 hours and costs 50 gold
      pieces per spell level. You can only record and ritually cast spells of a
      level equal to half your Fighter level (rounded down).</p>

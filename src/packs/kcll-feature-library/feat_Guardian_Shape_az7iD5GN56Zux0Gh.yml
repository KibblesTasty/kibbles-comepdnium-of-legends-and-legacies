    value: >-
      <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for
      Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you assume a treelike form, covered in
      leaves and bark, which lasts up to one hour, or until you end it as a
      bonus action or until you are incapacitated.</p>

      <p>You gain the following properties when you transform:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You can make yourself Large sized. If you do so, reach becomes 10
      feet.</li>

      <li>You can make a Wisdom (Athletics) check to initiate, maintain, or
      contest a grapple, and have a number of grappling appendages (in the form
      of grasping roots or branches) equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>

      <li>Each appendage serves as a natural weapon under the effect of
      shillelagh. While in this form, you can cast shillelagh on any weapon you
      are carrying.</li>

      <li>Your AC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You
      cannot benefit from the AC of armor or shields while in this form.</li>

      <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + twice
      your Druid level when you transform into tree form. When the form ends,
      you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.</li>

      <li>Any speed you have becomes 15 feet, unless the speed was lower. If you
      don't move during your turn, you have advantage on Ability Checks and
      Saving Throws against effects that would move you or knock you prone.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
      merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
      normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to
      wear a piece of equipment. Your equipment doesn't change to match the new
      form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to
      the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no
      effect until you leave the form. You can cast spells as normal while in
      this form.</p>

      <p>As a ritual that takes 1 hour, you can form a coven bond with one
      willing creature. While both of you are conscious and within 120 feet of
      each other, you gain the ability to share spell slots up to a spell slot
      of your Witch level divided by four (rounded down), minimum of 1st level
      slots. While this bond is active, you can use your Spellcasting feature to
      cast using their spell slots (consuming them as normal), and they can use
      their Spellcasting feature (if they have one) to cast using your
      qualifying spell slots (consuming them as normal).</p>

      <p>Additionally, you know their location at all times while they are part
      of your coven and within 120 feet of you. You can only be bonded to one
      creature with this bond at a time. You can end this coven at any time.</p>

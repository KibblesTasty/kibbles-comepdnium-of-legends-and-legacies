    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, as a bonus action, you can transform into a
      swirling burst of radiant sunlight, traveling up to 60 feet in a straight
      line. You can pass through creatures and objects, but are blocked by
      obstructions that completely block light (such as solid opaque walls).
      This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Hostile
      creatures of your choice in your path must make a Dexterity saving throw.
      On failure, they take 2d6 fire damage, 2d6 radiant damage, and are blinded
      until the start of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much
      damage and are not blinded. Allied creatures of your choice in your path
      gain 4d6 temporary hit points.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you cannot
      use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

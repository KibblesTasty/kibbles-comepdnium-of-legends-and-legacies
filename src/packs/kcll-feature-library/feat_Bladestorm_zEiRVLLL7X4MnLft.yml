  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 14th level, as an action when you are raging, you can start
      a Bladestorm. You can fling two light melee weapons you are carrying and
      pull any weapons already animated by Whirling Death into a wild vortex
      surrounding you. All creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you must
      make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus +
      your Strength modifier. On failure, they take 3d6 +103 your Strength
      modifier + your Rage bonus damage. The damage is increased by 1d6 for each
      Whirling Death weapon included (up to a maximum of +3d6). On success, a
      creature takes half as much damage. </p><p>On subsequent turns while
      raging, you can use your action to keep the Bladestorm going, forcing all
      creatures within 20 feet of you to make the save again. You can keep a
      Bladestorm going for a number of turns equal to your Strength modifier.
      You can use this feature once per rage. When a bladestorm ends, all
      included weapons fall to the ground around you.</p>

      <p>Starting at 18th level, you can move up to your speed to get within 5
      feet of a creature while using your On Your Feet feature. During this
      movement you gain resistance to all damage and the target regains an
      additional 1d8 hit points for each attack of opportunity made against you
      during this movement.</p>

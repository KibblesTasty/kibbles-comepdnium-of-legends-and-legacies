      <p>Starting at 11th level, when you target a creature within 60 feet of
      you with any ability, feature, or attack, you can mark them for punishment
      (no action required). The mark lasts until the creature ends their turn
      more than 60 feet from you, dies, or you mark another creature. Once per
      turn when the marked creature takes damage, they take an additional 1d8
      damage. This is increased to 1d12 if the target is frightened of you.</p>

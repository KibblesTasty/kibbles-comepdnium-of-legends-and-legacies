      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to gather and release fiery radiant
      power from your hands. Radiant Blasts are a ranged natural weapon attack
      with a normal range of 60 feet, and a long range of 120 feet, that deal
      1d6 fire or radiant damage (your choice). If the damage die increases to
      1d8 (through Warden features that increase the damage of your natural
      weapons), the damage becomes 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 radiant damage. You
      choose which damage type to add your modifier to when you deal damage. You
      can use your Strength or Wisdom (your choice) in place of your Dexterity
      for the attack and damage rolls of this ability.</p>

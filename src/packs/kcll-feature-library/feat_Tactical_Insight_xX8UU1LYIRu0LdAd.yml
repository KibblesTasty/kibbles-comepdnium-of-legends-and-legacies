      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can tactically assess a creature's options.
      As a bonus action, make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by
      a Charisma (Deception) check against any creature you can see within 60
      feet.</p>

      <p>On a success, you can see through their tactics, granting one of the
      following effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Determine Attack</strong>: You can cause them to have
      disadvantage on their next attack against a creature that can see or hear
      you.</li>

      <li><strong>Predict Movement:</strong> You deduce where they are planning
      to move on their next turn. They can choose to change their plans, but if
      they move anywhere else, their movement speed is reduced by 10 feet as
      they scramble to adapt.</li>

      <li><strong>Outwit Response:</strong> You can find their openings,
      negating their ability to use their reaction until the end of their next
      turn.</li>

      <li><strong>Expose Weakness: </strong>You can use Helpful Word to grant
      advantage against that target as part of the bonus action without
      expending a Leadership Die.</li>

      </ul>

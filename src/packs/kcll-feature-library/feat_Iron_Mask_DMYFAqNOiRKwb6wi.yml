      <p>Additionally at 7th level, you are exceptionally good at masking your
      emotions. Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) ability checks
      against you.</p><p>Additionally, you can suppress the effect of the
      frightened condition on yourself, but it requires concentration (as if
      concentrating on a spell). You cannot lose concentration on the effect,
      but cannot maintain it while concentrating on spell.</p>

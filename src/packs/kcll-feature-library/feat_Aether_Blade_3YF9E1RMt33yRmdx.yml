      <p>Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, when you roll
      initiative or as a bonus action at any time, you can manifest an oversized
      melee weapon of pure force energy. This cane take the shape of any bladed
      melee weapon, but deals 1d10 damage with a range of 5 feet regardless of
      its form.</p><p>When you attack with this weapon, you can use your
      Intelligence modifier (in place of your Strength) for attack and damage
      rolls. This weapon lasts until you let go of it, become incapacitated, or
      dismiss it as a bonus action.</p><p>While this weapon is temporary and
      magical, it counts as having a value of 1 sp for purposes of being treated
      as a material component in spells.</p><p>As a ritual taking 1 hour, you
      can absorb the power from a magical weapon with a bonus to attack and
      damage rolls. This cannot target artifacts, sentient weapons, or cursed
      items. At your GM's discretion, this might not work other weapons
      depending on their origin and type. This drains the power from the weapon,
      leaving it as a mundane weapon, but your Aether Blade gains the bonus to
      attack and damage rolls previously possessed by the magical weapon</p>

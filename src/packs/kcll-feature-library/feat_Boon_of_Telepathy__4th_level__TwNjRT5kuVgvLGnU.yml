      <p><span style="font-family:Signika, sans-serif">When you gain this
      feature, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see
      within 30 feet of you. You donâ€™t need to share a language with the
      creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature
      must be able to understand at least one language. Creatures you
      communicate with can reply in kind.</span></p>

      <p>Starting at 17th level, as an action you draw on the strength of the
      world beneath your feet to become an embodiment of its power for 1 minute.
      If you start your turn in contact with the ground you gain the following
      benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.</li>

      <li>You regain hit points equal to your Warden level.</li>

      <li>Creatures lose their flying speed in range of your Primal
      Interdiction.</li>

      <li>If you are targeted by a magic missile, a line spell, or a spell that
      requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 4-5 you are uneffected. On
      a 6, you are uneffected and the effect is reflected back at the caster as
      though it originized from you, turning the cast into the target.</li>

      <li>You can add number of bonus dice to your Seismic Reverberation pool
      equal to your proficiency bonus, up to a maximum of of your Warden
      level.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a
      long rest.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, all melee weapons with
      the light property also gain the thrown (20/60) property for you if they
      don't already have a thrown property with greater range.</p><p>
      Additionally, when you make an attack to throw a weapon, you can draw a
      weapon. You can either draw a weapon before throwing it, or draw a new
      weapon immediately after throwing a weapon if you have another weapon
      available.</p>

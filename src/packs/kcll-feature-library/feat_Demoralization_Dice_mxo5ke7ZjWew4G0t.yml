    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, whenever you spend a Leadership Die, you gain a
      Demoralization Die of equal size. Demoralization Dice last until you have
      gone 1 minute without earning or spending one. You can spend
      Demoralization Die as a reaction on one of the following
      effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Make it Excruciating.</strong> When a
      creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from a weapon attack roll made
      by an ally of yours, as a reaction you can expend up Demoralization Dice
      (up to your Leadership Die limit), rolling them and causing the target to
      take additional damage equal the value of the rolled
      dice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don't Touch That.</strong> When a creature
      attacks an allied creature within 30 feet of you, as a reaction you can
      expend one Demoralization Dice, rolling it and reducing the attacker's
      attack roll.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are You Sure?</strong> When a creature
      ends their turn within 5 feet of you, as a reaction you can expend
      Demoralization Dice (up to your Leadership Die limit) and force the
      creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your Charisma modifier +
      your proficiency bonus. On failure, the creature uses their reaction to
      move a number of feet away from you equal to 10 x the Demoralization Dice
      spent. The target automatically passes if they are immune to the
      frightened condition.</p></li></ul>

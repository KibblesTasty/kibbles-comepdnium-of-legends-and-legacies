      <p>Starting at 17th level, you can call upon the power of the sun to
      embody its power for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You shed bright light for 60 feet, and dim light
      for additional 60 feet. The bright light is
      sunlight.</p></li><li><p>Creatures in the bright light you shed have
      disadvantage on saving throws against your Warden abilities and
      spells.</p></li><li><p>When you make a Radiant Blast, you can shoot a beam
      of energy instead of an attack, forcing all creatures in a 60 foot line to
      make a Dexterity saving throw against 8 + your attack ability modifier +
      your proficiency bonus, taking damage equal to your Radiant Blast damage
      on failure, or half as much on a success.</p></li><li><p>When you deal
      radiant damage against a target, you imbue the target with a radiant
      illumination, granting advantage to the next attack made against that
      target before the start of your next turn.</p></li></ul><p>Once you use
      this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>

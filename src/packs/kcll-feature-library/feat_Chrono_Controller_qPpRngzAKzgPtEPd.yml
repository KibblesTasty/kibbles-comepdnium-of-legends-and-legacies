      <p>Starting at 14th level, your mastery of time becomes more extensive and
      intuitive. You can no longer lose concentration on spells granted by your
      Innate Magic feature from this subclass by taking damage, and when you
      cast them, you can cast them as if they were cast with a spell slot one
      level higher than their default spell level when they have an applicable
      effect.</p>

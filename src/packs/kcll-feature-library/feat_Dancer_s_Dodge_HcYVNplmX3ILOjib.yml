    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, when you take the Dodge action while you are not
      wearing armor or carrying a shield, you can use Distract, Helpful Word,
      Urgent Orders, or Rallying Mark without expending a leadership die. When
      you do so, it applies as if you had spent 1 leadership die on it for its
      effect.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you take the Dodge action, you can expend leadership
      dice to grant enough attacks through Battlefield Presence. You can grant a
      number of attacks equal to the leadership dice spent, up to your per turn
      limit.</p>

      <p>Additionally at 1st level, you can glimpse future possibilities. When
      you roll initiative, record the result on the d20. Within the next minute,
      you can replace one of your attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws
      with the roll.</p><p> Alternatively, you can replace one attack roll or
      contested ability check of an enemy within 5 feet of you with the roll.
      This range extends to the range of your Primal Interdiction when you gain
      that feature.</p>

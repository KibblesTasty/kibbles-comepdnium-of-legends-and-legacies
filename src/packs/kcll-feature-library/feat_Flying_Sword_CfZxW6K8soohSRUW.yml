      <p><span style="font-family:Signika, sans-serif">Starting at 3rd level,
      during a long rest you can touch a melee weapon, infusing it magical
      power. This Flying Sword can be carried or stowed like a normal weapon, or
      you can ready it, causing it to float beside you. While an Flying Sword is
      readied, you can make attacks with it as part the Attack action, sending
      it out to strike a target.</span></p><p

      style="font-family:Signika, sans-serif">Attacks made with your Flying
      Sword are considered melee weapon attacks with the weapon, but you can use
      your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
      for attack and damage rolls, and you can make this attack against a target
      out to a range of 30 feet away from you. If the weapon has the heavy or
      special property, this range is halved to 15 feet; and if the weapon has
      the light property, this range is doubled to 60 feet.</span></p>

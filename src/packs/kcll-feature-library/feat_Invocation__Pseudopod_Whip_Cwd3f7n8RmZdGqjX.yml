    value: >-
      <p><span style="font-family:Signika, sans-serif">You can create a natural
      weapon taking the form of an acidic whip. It has the reach and finesse
      properties, and deals 2d4 acid damage on hit. You can consume a weapon
      with a bonus to attack and damage rolls, destroying it and granting your
      acidic whip the bonus to attack and damage rolls of the consumed weapon
      (this cannot be used on cursed items, artifacts, or sentient items). This
      weapon counts as a whip for the purposes of weapon interactions (such as
      feats). At your DM's discretion, it may be able to absorb other properties
      from absorbed magical weapons.</span></p>

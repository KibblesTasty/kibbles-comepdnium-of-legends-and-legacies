  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 11th level, the first time the doggo would drop to 0 hit
      points, it instead drops to 1, and then regains 1d6 hit points for each
      allied creature within 60 feet of it, up to a maximum number of d6 equal
      to its proficiency bonus. Once it uses this feature, it cannot use it
      again until it completes a short or long rest.</p><p> Additionally, the
      doggo is considered to be immune to the frightened condition while an
      allied creature it can see or hear is within 60 feet to act brave in front
      of.</p>

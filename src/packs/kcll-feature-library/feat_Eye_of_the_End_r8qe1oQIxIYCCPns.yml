      <p>Starting at 1st level when you follow this Tradition, you gain the
      ability to look into a creature's fate and see their doom. As as an
      action, you can look upon a creature within 30 feet that you can see
      through the perspective of the void, seeing glimpses the many horrible
      ways they could suffer or die and gaining insight into their
      fears.</p><p>You gain advantage on your next Charisma (Intimidation) check
      against that creature in the next 1 minute, and you roll a d20 fate die.
      The next time they make a saving throw against one of your Occultist
      spells within 1 minute, they use the fate die instead of rolling of a
      save, forewarning you to the potential outcome of your spell.</p><p>Once
      you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short
      or long rest.</p>

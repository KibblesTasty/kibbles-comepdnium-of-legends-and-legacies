      <p>As a Spellfist, you are the embodiment of raw power and arcane energy,
      a brawler who channels magic into every punch. Where other Spellblades may
      wield elegant weapons or conjure dazzling spells from a distance, you
      understand that sometimes, magic is most effective when it’s delivered up
      close and personal. Your hands are not just weapons, but conduits for your
      magical force, and your style of combat reflects this, as brutal and
      direct as it is unpredictably magical.</p><p>Whether you’re a former
      street fighter who discovered an innate talent for magic or a spellcaster
      who decided the best way to channel your power was through physical force,
      you’ve chosen a path that combines the cerebral challenge of magic with
      the visceral thrill of melee combat. As a Spellfist, you’re a force to be
      reckoned with, breaking through enemy defenses with a flurry of magically
      enhanced punches and turning the tide of any battle with your explosive
      arcane power.</p>

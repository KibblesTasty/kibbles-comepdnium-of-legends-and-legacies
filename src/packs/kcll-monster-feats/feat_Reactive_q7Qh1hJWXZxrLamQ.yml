      <p>Some monsters are exceptional at handling many foes at the same time,
      and core tool of doing so is be able to respond quickly. The monster gains
      the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>Reactive.</strong> The monster
      gains an additional reaction per round.</li><li><strong>Vengeful
      Blow.</strong> When the monster is hit by an attack, it can make one
      attack as a reaction against the attacker, if the attacker is in range of
      an available action.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> + 1</li></ul>

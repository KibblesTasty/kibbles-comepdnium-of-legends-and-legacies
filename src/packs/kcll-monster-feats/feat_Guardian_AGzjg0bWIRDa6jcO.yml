  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A monster specialized in protection, it makes another creature harder
      to take down, and ensures that attackers have to go through it. This feat
      is most appropriate on a monster with high loyalty to another creature,
      such as a guard dog, bodyguard, or golem. The creature gains the following
      features:</p><ul><li><strong>Interference.</strong> While this creature is
      within 5 feet of another creature, that creature has resistance to area of
      effect damage.</li><li><strong>Body Blocking.</strong> At the start of the
      creature’s turn, it can exchange places with another willing creature
      within 5 feet. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity for
      either creature.</li><li><strong>Intervention (Recharge 4–6).</strong>
      When this creature is within movement speed of an allied creature that
      takes damage, it can use its reaction to move up to its movement speed to
      that creature and take the instance of damage that triggered the reaction
      instead of the target.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> 0</li></ul>

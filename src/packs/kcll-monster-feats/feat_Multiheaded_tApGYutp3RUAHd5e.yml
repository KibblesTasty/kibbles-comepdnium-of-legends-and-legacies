    value: >-
      <p>The monster has a rather drastic mutation such as having another head.
      This mutation is almost always the result of a monster that is from an
      artificial origin, warped by an area of high magic, or is extra planar in
      origin. It is most typically found on monstrosities, beats, or creatures
      that share their appearance but not creature type (such as a Hellhound).
      It gains the following feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Multiheaded.</strong>
      When the creature takes its bite attack, it can make a second bite attack
      as part of the same action. This can target either the same creature or
      another creature within range. The creature gains advantage on perception
      checks and wisdom or intelligence saving throws.</li><li><strong>CR

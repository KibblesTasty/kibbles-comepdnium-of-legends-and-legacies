  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monster has mutated to store a great deal of elemental energy
      within its body which it discharges defensively when hit. Though most
      often found in eels, with more magically powered evolution many creatures
      might find such a defense expedient. The monster gains the following
      features:</p><ul><li><strong>Lightning Immunity.</strong> The creature is
      immune to lightning damage.</li><li><strong>Charged Shock (Recharge
      6).</strong> The first time a creature is hit by a melee weapon attack, it
      deals PBd4 lightning damage to the attacker. The damage decreases each
      time it is hit by 1d4, until it recharges the ability (resetting the
      damage dealt to PBd4). Being hit by lightning damage automatically
      recharges the ability.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong>
      +1</li></ul>

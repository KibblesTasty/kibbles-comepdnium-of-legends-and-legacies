    value: >-
      <p>This feature works best for monsters with chaotic behavior patterns,
      brutes, or monsters that work of a mysterious cunning and scheming...
      plans so complicated the loop back to seeming
      random.</p><ul><li><strong>Mark of Opportunity.</strong> At the end of
      each the monsters turns, it randomly selects a target within movement
      range, which it marks. Until it uses its ability again, all melee attacks
      it make against the target have advantage, and the first time it hits that
      target, the hit becomes a critical strike. If the target ends its turn out
      of the monsters movement range, the monster rolls a new
      target.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +Â½</li></ul>

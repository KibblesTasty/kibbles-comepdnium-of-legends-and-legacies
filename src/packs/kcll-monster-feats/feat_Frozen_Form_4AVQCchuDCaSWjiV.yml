    value: >-
      <p>The monster becomes an animated statue of ice in the shape of the
      normal monster.</p><ul><li><strong>Frozen Body.</strong> The monster gains
      immunity to Cold damage, and resistance to slashing and piercing damage.
      It gains vulnerability to fire and bludgeoning damage. Any damage that is
      not piercing or slashing damage the monster deals is converted to cold
      damage.</li><li><strong>Shatter.</strong> When the monster is reduced to 0
      hit points, it explodes into shards of ice. All creatures within 15 feet
      of it must make a Dexterity saving throw with DC of 8 + CON mod + PB,
      taking PBd8 piercing and PBd8 cold damage on failure, or half as much on a
      successful save.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong> +Â½</li></ul>

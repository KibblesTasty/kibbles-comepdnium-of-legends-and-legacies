  description:
    value: >-
      <p>The monster can move with a surge of power that endangers all nearby
      creatures in a burst of ferocity. This feat is most appropriate on
      aggressive creatures that either have many weapons (such as claws) or
      large weapons (such as great axes), and prefer to charge into groups of
      enemies aggressively. It gains the following feature:
      </p><ul><li><p><strong>Whirlwind (Recharge 4–6).</strong> As part of its
      multiattack action (or as action if it lacks the multiattack action), the
      monster strikes out all creatures of its choice within 5 feet of it.
      Targets must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + STR mod + PB,
      taking PBd8 + STR mod damage on a failed saving throw or half as much on a
      successful saving throw. </p></li><li><p><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong>
      +½</p></li></ul>

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Honor is a foreign concept to this monster, and its developed a set of
      survival skills that make it particularly obnoxious to fight against. This
      is most likely to be found on intelligent creatures that make their way
      through the less refined circles of society, such as thieves or goblins,
      but can make a fun addition to a particularly obnoxious bird or beast. It
      gains the following features: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Distract.</strong>
      When this creature would provoke an opportunity attack it instead attempts
      to distract the attacker. The attacker must succeed a Wisdom saving throw
      with a DC of 8 + CHA mod + PB or automatically misses their opportunity
      attack. </p></li><li><p><strong>Dirty Trick.</strong> As a bonus action,
      this creature throws dirt or sand into the eyes of another creature within
      5 feet. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + DEX
      mod + PB or become blinded until the start of this323 creature’s next
      turn. Once this is used on a creature, that creature automatically passes
      subsequent saves against it, and any creature that witnessed the move has
      advantage on saves against it. </p></li><li><p><strong>CR
      Adjustment:</strong> +½</p></li></ul>

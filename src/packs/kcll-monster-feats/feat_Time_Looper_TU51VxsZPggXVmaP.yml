    value: >-
      <p>A particularly strange twist of fate has granted this monster the
      ability to twist the flow of time around it, jumping back and forth
      between time.</p><ul><li><strong>Reset (Recharge 5–6).</strong> At the
      start of the creature’s turn, it can use its reaction to regain full hit
      points, recharge all other abilities, regain all resources, clear all
      conditions and spells affecting it, and teleport to anywhere it has been
      since the start of its last turn.</li><li><strong>CR Adjustment:</strong>
      ×2</li></ul><section id="secret-LZql9SpbGpUTynLV"
      class="secret"><h5>Tactical Hint</h5><p>The obvious solution that requires
      no hint is that if the target is killed before it uses or recharges the
      ability, there is no need for additional solutions.</p><p>However, more
      tactical approaches can result in easier times. Once the creature has used
      the ability once, you can reveal the details of the ability on a
      Intelligence (Arcana) ability check with a DC of 15 or higher, which would
      reveal that it needs its reaction to use the ability. A reaction can be
      denied by any effect that incapacitates a creature, some features, or some
      spells like shocking grasp.</p><h5>Running the Creature</h5><p>While this
      might sound challenging to run, you can simply keep additional copies of
      the creature block and reset to another one when it uses the ability,
      minus the expended ability.</p></section>

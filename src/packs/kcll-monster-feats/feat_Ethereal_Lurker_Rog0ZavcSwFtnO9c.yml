      flexibility, gaining the following feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Ether
      Phase.</strong> At the end of the monsterâ€™s turn, it enters the Ethereal
      plane until the start of its next turn. When it returns to the material
      plane at the start of its turn, it appears in an empty space within 10
      feet of where it disappeared. While on the Ethereal Plane, it remains
      aware of the position of creatures in the material plane, but can only be
      affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane</li><li><strong>CR

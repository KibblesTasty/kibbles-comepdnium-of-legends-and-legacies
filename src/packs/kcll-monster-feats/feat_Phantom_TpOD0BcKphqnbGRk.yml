      <p>The monster gains the ability to create illusionary duplicates of
      itself, providing false targets and mirror images to distract and confuse
      its foes. This could be some magic it has mastered, or an innate property
      of its nature, warped by magic. It gains the following
      feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Phantom Army.</strong> At the end of each of
      its turns, the creature creates [[/r 1d4 + 1]] phantom duplicates of
      itself, and then teleports itself and its duplicates to unoccupied spaces
      within 30 feet of it. Each duplicate has the save attributes and AC as the
      creature, but only 1 hit point and cannot take any actions, disappearing
      at the start of the creatureâ€™s next turn.</li><li><strong>CR
      Adjustment:</strong> +2</li></ul><section class="secret"
      id="secret-E8UIMyoQmECqX8So"><h5>Tactical Hint</h5><p>On seeing a phantom
      destroyed, you can offer the players the chance to make Intelligence
      (Arcana) or Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC of 14. On success, you
      can reveal the details of the ability, which makes it easy to defeat.
      Magic Missile is a particularly effective solution, but any effect that
      deals guaranteed damage can quickly check duplicates.</p></section>

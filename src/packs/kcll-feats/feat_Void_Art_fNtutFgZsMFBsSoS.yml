  description:
    value: >-
      <p>After intense study and sudden enlightenment youâ€™ve mastered the true
      essence of cutting through space itself. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Part Magic.</strong> When you succeed a
      Dexterity saving throw against a spell or similar magical effect and you
      would take half damage, you can use your reaction to cut the effect from
      existence around you, taking no damage instead.</li><li>You gain the
      special Void Strike action (below).</li></ul><h5 id="void-strike">Void
      Strike</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Action, Supernatural)</em></p><p>As an
      action, you make a special attack that strikes the dimensional boundaries
      around a creature, disrupting them and potentially briefly pulling the
      creature into the ethereal plane. The target makes a Charisma saving
      throw. On failure, they take force damage equal to 2d6 + your Mystic Path
      modifier and are banished to the ethereal plane until the start of your
      next turn. On success, they take half as much and are not banished to the
      ethereal plane.</p><p>The creature cannot move while on the ethereal
      plane, but can otherwise take any action they can normally take, but they
      cannot interact with things on the material plane unless they normally
      could. You can choose to do no damage with this ability, and the target
      can choose to fail their save. The number of d6 damage the target takes
      increases when your proficiency bonus increase, remaining equal to your
      proficiency bonus.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it
      again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

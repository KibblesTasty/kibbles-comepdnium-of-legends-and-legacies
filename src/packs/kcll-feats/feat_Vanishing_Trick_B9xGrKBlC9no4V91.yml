  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You master an esoteric art of vanishing and leaving something (or
      someone) behind in your space, swapping positions with them. You gain the
      following abilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Decoy Death.</strong> If you would
      be reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can use
      Nether Swap as a reaction. When you do so, you instead fall to 1 hit
      point, with any additional damage beyond what would reduce to 1 hit point
      being taken by the object you swap places with. You can do this even if
      you have no use remaining, but once you use it this way you cannot use it
      this way again until you complete a long rest. You can only target objects
      when using it this way.</li><li>You gain the Nether Swap special bonus
      action (below).</li></ul><h5 id="nether-swap">Nether
      Swap</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Bonus Action, Supernatural)</em></p><p>As
      a bonus action, you swap places with a Small to Large creature or object
      that is not being worn or carried you can see within 15 feet of you. If
      the target is an unwilling creature, it makes a Charisma saving throw
      against your Mystic Path DC. On a successful195 save, the ability fails
      and neither creature is teleported. The maximum distance increases by 5
      feet when your proficiency bonus increases (always equaling 5 times your
      proficiency bonus).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it
      again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You master the art of moving like lightning... literally. You gain the
      following benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Bonus.</strong>
      Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence ability score by 1, to
      a maximum of 20.</li><li><strong>Lightning Dodge.</strong> When you
      succeed a dexterity saving throw, you can teleport up to 5
      feet</li><li>You gain the Lightning Leap special attack
      (below).</li></ul><h5 id="lightning-leap">Lightning Leap</h5><p><em>Active
      Ability (Attack, Supernatural)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action
      on your turn, you can replace one attack by turning into lightning,
      leaping (as lightning) to a creature or empty space within 10 feet. If you
      target a creature, you can target a chain of creatures within 10 feet of
      the previous target, targeting a number of creatures equal to your
      proficiency bonus. Each creature you target makes a Dexterity saving,
      taking 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
      successful save. You then teleport to an empty spot of your choice
      adjacent to the last target of the chain. The damage increases by 1d6 and
      the range (initial and jump distance) increases by 5 feet whenever your
      proficiency bonus increases.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot
      use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

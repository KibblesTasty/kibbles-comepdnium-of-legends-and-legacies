      <p>Youâ€™ve danced among the flames so long and with such skill that now the
      flames dance along with you. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Bonus.</strong> Increase your
      Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma ability score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.191</li><li><strong>Through The Flames.</strong> You have advantage on
      Dexterity saving throws where failing them would result in taking fire
      damage.</li><li>You gain the Cinder Sweep special attack
      (below).</li></ul><h5 id="cinder-sweep">Cinder Sweep</h5><p><em>Active
      Ability (Attack, Supernatural)</em></p><p>When you take the Attack action
      on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with moving up to 5 feet
      without provoking attacks of opportunity and then cause an explosion of
      fire around you. All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On failure, a creature takes 2d6 fire damage and becomes
      ignited. Creatures that are ignited take 1d6 fire damage at the end of
      each of their turns until a creature within 5 feet of the ignited target
      spends their action to douse the flames. On success, creatures take half
      as much damage and are not ignited. The initial fire damage increases by
      1d6 when your proficiency bonus increases.</p><p>Once you use this
      feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long
      rest.</p>

    value: >-
      <p>You master the art of gathering elemental power within yourself to
      unleash in blasts akin to a dragonâ€™s breath. You gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Ability Score Bonus.</strong> Increase your
      Constitution, or Charisma ability score by 1, to a maximum of
      20.</li><li><strong>Familiarity.</strong> You gain advantage on saving
      throws against the breath weapons of dragons.</li></ul><h5
      id="dragon-breath">Dragon Breath</h5><p><em>Active Ability (Attack,
      Supernatural)</em></p><p>As an attack as part of the attack action, you
      can unleash a cone of elemental devastation. Creatures in a 15 foot cone
      or 5 by 30 foot line (your choice) must make a Dexterity (for acid, fire
      or lightning) or Constitution (for cold or poison) saving throw. On
      failure, they take 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage
      (select when you take this feat), or half as much on a successful one. The
      number of d6 increases when your proficiency bonus increases (to 4d6 at
      5th level, 5d6 at 9th level, 6d6 at 13th level, and 7d6 at 17th
      level).</p><p>If you are transformed by the Dragon Aspect of the Dragon
      Form feat, the area of effect is doubled (to a 30 foot cone or 60 foot
      line).</p><p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you
      complete a short or long rest.</p>

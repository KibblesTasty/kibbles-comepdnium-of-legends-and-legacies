          <p>Wisps of purple smoke and dancing shadows rise from the ritual as
          the young human woman with strange magical markings tattooed across
          her hands whispers words in a language long forgotten, calling forth
          ancient powers. The woods creak and bend, black wings beating as a
          raven alights on the outstretched hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as
          black as the raven’s. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in
          agreement.</p><p>A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames
          burst into a form taller than an ogre, causing her enemies to flee.
          She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire
          spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with
          searing magical flames.</p><p>The mysterious halfling woman gives a
          knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you’ve
          come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is
          she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only
          in riddle.</p><p>Occultists are those that follow the old ways: a path
          of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force
          magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it.
          They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that
          few fully understand, even those that use them, but that they know it
          will work, for it always has.</p><h2>Ancient
          Traditions</h2><p>Occultists are spellcasters following legacies that
          go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or
          influenced by another member of their tradition, their path to magic
          involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned
          from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p><p>They often personify
          aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing
          and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists
          tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping
          any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for
          their domains, asking for what they take, and carefully giving thought
          to their actions.</p><p>Each tradition that appears in the Occultist
          is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story.
          Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their
          traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers
          and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be
          more likely to turn to them than a Wizard; at least an Occultist makes
          sense to them, even if they are scared by their
          powers.</p><h2>Spiritual Magic</h2><p>A common thread of the magic
          wielded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the
          demidivine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic, oft
          through intermediaries such as gods, spirits, elementals, and
          more.</p><p>Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through
          the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the
          spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects. The
          verbal component of an Occultist’s spell might be calling upon a
          spirit to work their wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or
          words in a language designed to bind and persuade.</p><h2>Creating an
          Occultist</h2><p>When creating an Occultist, the most important
          decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an
          Occultist is distinct, with divergent flavor and calling upon a
          different aspect of folklore.</p><h3 id="quick-build">Quick
          Build</h3><p>You can make an Occultist quickly by following these
          suggestions.</p><p>First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score,
          followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose a background
          that lives on the fringes of society. Third, choose the chill touch,
          guidance, and poison spray cantrips, along with the following
          1st-level spells: burning hands, cure wounds, and hideous
          laughter.</p>

          <p>A human runs her hand across their blade tracing esoteric patterns
          that alight at a touch, flames flickering alive in their wake casting
          a sudden blazing light over the gloomy cavern, creatures of the dark
          shrinking back from the fire’s light. A gnome’s eyes begin to glow as
          a massive greatsword of energy condenses into their waiting hand,
          forming a blade of pure energy, twice their height but weightless in
          their hands. The edgy elf vanishes from sight, teleporting behind
          their foe before muttering something cryptically and cutting them
          down.</p><p>A Spellblade combines magic and martial talent in a
          perfect blend, able to blend their use of them into a single art.
          Rather than being a Wizard that happens to be good with a sword or a
          Fighter that knows some magic, a Spellblade is defined by their
          ability to merge the spells and martial talents into a single strike:
          a Spellstrike.</p><h2>Pursuit of Mastery</h2><p>Becoming a Spellblade
          isn’t an accident—it’s a difficult path to master and requires intense
          concentration and conditioning to master fluidly casting spells in the
          storm of battle in perfect sync with your attacks. Spellblades are,
          consequently, almost always driven by some form of motivation that
          have made them strive for this unique style of perfection. Some view
          it as an art or tradition important to them, some view it as the
          ultimate weapon to overcome a great obstacle, and some pursue it
          because of the challenge itself, seeking to prove
          themselves.</p><h2>Rare Talent</h2><p>Spellblades are uncommon,
          requiring an unusual degree of talent to master their arts compared to
          those that choose to focus and specialize in only one of their two
          challenging fields. Adventurers are already a rare breed, but
          Spellblades are rarer still, which often causes them to defy
          expectations. A bookish and mild Spellblade may be surprisingly nimble
          or strong, while one that may look a musclebound oaf may be
          surprisingly erudite.</p><h2>Creating A Spellblade</h2><p>The most
          important place to start when making a Spellblade is knowing what drew
          your character to this difficult and rare path. The path of a
          Spellblade is one that has few mundane uses—they are not scholars and
          their skills serve little purpose outside the adventuring arts, so
          what drove your character to master these? There’s an intentionality
          to a Spellblade similar to that which might be found in a
          Paladin.</p><h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a
          Spellblade quickly by following these suggestions.</p><p>If you wish
          to follow the technique of the Aether Blade, Battlemage, or Flying
          Sword, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by
          Dexterity, and then Constitution.</p><p>If you wish to follow the
          technique of the Guardian or Spellfist, put your highest ability score
          in Strength, followed by Constitution, and then Intelligence.</p><p>If
          you wish to follow the technique of the Mage Hunter, Rimeblade,
          Spellshot, or Swiftblade, put your highest ability score in Dexterity,
          followed by Intelligence, and then Constitution.</p>

        value: >-
          <p>The charging minotaur’s bellowed cry becomes a thunderous crash as
          a pillar of ice erupts in its path, the ground shuddering from the
          impact of horn and frost. A large man advances on the wreckage, his
          armor covered in rime, even as fire crackles from his fist.</p><p>The
          bloodthirsty howls of the werewolf pack turns to confusion when the
          scrawny elf that looked only to be dinner rebuffs a massive werewolf’s
          charge, their arms swelling in size becoming bear-like limbs, dwarfing
          the surrounding werewolves’ own once impressive claws. All around, the
          werewolf pack can only look on in confusion as the elf continues to
          grow, grabbing and flinging a yelping werewolf like a rag
          doll.</p><p>The goblins have only a moment of glory, springing their
          ambush and pouring out of the forest upon the hapless group of humans
          before the plants beneath their feet writhe to life. To their shock
          and horror they find grasping vines dangling them from trees like
          misbegotten ornaments, frantically trying to remember the word in
          common for ‘surrender’.</p><p>The bandit looks at his broken weapon
          haft in confusion, and then back up at the large woman in strange
          rocky armor that seems unaffected by the weapon that has just been
          broken against her. His confusion lasts only a moment before the earth
          heaves beneath him and tosses him from his feet in a violent crunching
          shake. ‘Urk!’, a crushing force explodes the air from his lungs, a
          heavy stone boot planted on his chest as the large jagged form looms
          over him.</p><h2 id="primal-champions">Primal Champions</h2><p>Wardens
          are not born of civilization and order. Though some Wardens will seek
          to defend such things (or at least tolerate them), they are those that
          have harnessed primal chaotic powers. Lashing, roiling forces of
          untamed energy, that left unchecked would wash civilization from the
          face of the material plane as if it were but a temporary blip.</p><h2
          id="aspects-of-power">Aspects of Power</h2><p>The powers of a Warden
          are expressions of deep and primal forces. They are power given
          sentience and will, entropy and destruction harnessed and focused to
          purpose and cause. They channel their power as a conduit, bringing it
          to heel through force of will and inner conviction. As a blacksmith
          forges a lump of iron to take on the keen edge of a sword, a Warden
          must always refine their power, tame and temper it to be a force of
          change rather than raw destruction.</p><h2 id="chosen-powers">Chosen
          Powers</h2><p>While the situations that lead a Warden to take up their
          mantle of powers varies widely, their powers are reflections of who
          they are, a synchronization that would be impossible to thrust upon
          those that did not choose their path. A Warden may feel they had no
          choice but to embrace their primal powers and wield them for a cause,
          but at the heart of the power is a choice: a choice to fight, a choice
          to stand, and a choice to be a champion.</p><h2
          id="creating-a-warden">Creating a Warden</h2><p>When creating a Warden
          consider the factors that have led them down their path. A mortal
          connected to deep primal powers isn’t a common thing. Is this
          something your character sought out to right an ancient wrong, or
          something dropped in their lap they now have to deal with? How do you
          want to use this power, and what principles will you have?</p><h3
          id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3><p>To make a Warden quickly, first
          place your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution
          and Wisdom. Second, choose a wilderness-related background.</p>

          <p>Two vast armies stand across the field of death, fear gripping the
          heart of every soldier. From their ranks, the banner is carried
          forth—a shining beacon without fear. Before they even know it, their
          feet pound across the ground, their fear left behind as they follow
          their symbol of hope to victory.</p><p>Collapsing to the ground, a man
          succumbs to wounds, exhaustion, terror, and the overwhelming clash of
          steel all around. Death closes in, but before it can claim him, a hand
          appears, pulling him to his feet. “On your feet, soldier”.</p><p>The
          line will soon be overrun—until, among the broken ranks of soldiers, a
          lone soldier spots his liege. She stands, unwilling to turn aside,
          unwilling to step back from danger, holding back the horde of enemies
          alone. Retreat is no longer an option. With newfound strength behind
          every blow, the soldiers stand and fight like no one has ever fought
          before.</p><p>“How did you do it?” hisses the marauder, his sword
          dropped before him in surrender. He kneels beside his captured
          comrades, encircled by a smaller force that seems to have come from
          nowhere. The victorious general smiles knowingly and shrugs. “Luck,”
          he says. “And perhaps a bit of planning.”</p><p>Warlords are force
          multipliers for their companions. Some may be fearsome combatants,
          while others may never lift a weapon, but in either case their
          presence on the battlefield will drive their allies to new heights,
          guiding them safely through what would surely have been their
          doom.</p><p>How victory is stolen from the jaws of defeat can vary,
          from inciting crazed zeal, to tempering an overeager charge, to
          pulling their friends out of the line of danger in the nick of time.
          The sole commonality is that a Warlord alone is but a man, while a
          Warlord with their companions is a legend.</p><h2
          id="purpose-and-drive">Purpose and Drive</h2><p>Purpose is a common
          element to those that walk the path of a Warlord. Purpose empowers
          Warlords to be a larger-than-life, and allows them to be a guiding
          hand to their comrades. Some Warlords may not seek any particular
          cause, and merely pursue victory— such as blood, hair, or
          scales—either as a tribute to a god they worship or simply to attain
          personal glory. More often, though, a Warlord is driven by a higher
          purpose—a loyalty to their country or their men, a drive to protect
          the innocent or crush the weak.</p><h2 id="power-of-presence">Power of
          Presence</h2><p>Most warlords have no explicitly magical powers, but
          the presence on the battlefield allows people to exceed what they
          might have thought of as their own limits, pushing beyond what they
          could hope to achieve on their own. A Warlord will make their allies
          feel like they’ve become better at everything, they will make problems
          seem surmountable, and they will make the path clear. They make the
          world less bleak, they make the foes less terrifying. When you have a
          Warlord on your side, more things go right.</p><h2
          id="creating-a-warlord">Creating a Warlord</h2><p>When creating a
          Warlord you should always start with answering the question: what sort
          of Presence does this person bring to the battlefield? Are they a
          charismatic inspiration to their allies that drives them to fight on?
          Are they a wise veteran who acts as a force multiplier for their
          companions, offering pointers and grit? Or are they a scheming
          manipulator who sees one step ahead of any move their foes can make,
          always making sure their allies are in the right spot?</p><h3
          id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a warlord quickly by
          following these suggestions. For a Commander, select Strength as your
          highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a Chieftain or Paragon,
          select Strength as your highest ability score, followed by Charisma.
          For a Noble, select Charisma as your highest ability score, followed
          by Constitution. For a Packleader, select Dexterity as your highest
          ability score, followed by Wisdom. For a Tactician, select
          Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by
          Constitution.</p>

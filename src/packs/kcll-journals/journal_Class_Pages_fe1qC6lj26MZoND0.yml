          <p>Wisps of purple smoke and dancing shadows rise from the ritual as
          the young human woman with strange magical markings tattooed across
          her hands whispers words in a language long forgotten, calling forth
          ancient powers. The woods creak and bend, black wings beating as a
          raven alights on the outstretched hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as
          black as the raven’s. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in
          agreement.</p><p>A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames
          burst into a form taller than an ogre, causing her enemies to flee.
          She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire
          spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with
          searing magical flames.</p><p>The mysterious halfling woman gives a
          knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you’ve
          come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is
          she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only
          in riddle.</p><p>Occultists are those that follow the old ways: a path
          of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force
          magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it.
          They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that
          few fully understand, even those that use them, but that they know it
          will work, for it always has.</p><h3 id="ancient-traditions">Ancient
          Traditions</h3><p>Occultists are spellcasters following legacies that
          go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or
          influenced by another member of their tradition, their path to magic
          involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned
          from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p><p>They often personify
          aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing
          and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists
          tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping
          any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for
          their domains, asking for what they take, and carefully giving thought
          to their actions.</p><p>Each tradition that appears in the Occultist
          is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story.
          Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their
          traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers
          and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be
          more likely to turn to them than a Wizard; at least an Occultist makes
          sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p><h3
          id="spiritual-magic">Spiritual Magic</h3><p>A common thread of the
          magic wielded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the
          demidivine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic, oft
          through intermediaries such as gods, spirits, elementals, and
          more.</p><p>Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through
          the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the
          spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects. The
          verbal component of an Occultist’s spell might be calling upon a
          spirit to work their wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or
          words in a language designed to bind and persuade.</p><h3
          id="creating-an-occultist">Creating an Occultist</h3><p>When creating
          an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you
          follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct, with divergent
          flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore.</p><h3
          id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3><p>You can make an Occultist quickly
          by following these suggestions.</p><p>First, Wisdom should be your
          highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second,
          choose a background that lives on the fringes of society. Third,
          choose the chill touch, guidance, and poison spray cantrips, along
          with the following 1st-level spells: burning hands, cure wounds, and
          hideous laughter.</p>

        <h5>Curse Spell Material Components </h5><p>All curse spells require
        “something from the target creature—such as blood, hair, or scales—which
        the spell consumes” as the material component. This can be satisfied by
        either by having that material, or being in range to touch the creature
        while casting the spell. </p><h5>Upcasting curses </h5><p>All curses
        with no upcasting trait gain the following upcasting text: "At Higher
        Levels. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is
        dispelled and grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration."
        </p><h5>Remove Curse Interaction </h5><p>The remove curse spell cast a
        level equal to higher than the level of the curse spell ends the effect
        of any curse spell.</p>

        <p>Blood magic is a special category of spells which drain the vitality
        of living creatures to cast magic. Blood magic might not always be
        considered evil, but you should consult with your DM about local
        attitudes toward blood magic in their setting.</p><p>Blood Magic may not
        be for everyone and frequently involves gore and themes of self-harm; be
        sure to consult with everyone at your table to make sure this content is
        suitable for your game.</p><h3>Limited Availability</h3><p>Blood magic
        is not restricted by any special feat or requirement, but your DM may
        rule that there are special requirements to learn blood magic. The only
        inherent restriction is that the
        @UUID[Compendium.kibbles-compendium-of-legends-and-legacies.kcll-feats.Item.CoKlm2Nw45uwDMHm]{Hemomancer}
        feat is required to cast spells using only your hit points (bypassing
        spell slots).</p><h3>Blood Components</h3><p>Blood magic spells all have
        a material component that reads "a drop [or splash] of blood worth [X]
        hit points". If a material component is "up to X" hit points, you can
        choose to spend as little as 1 hit point, or up to the full amount
        listed.</p><p>When you cast a blood magic spell, you take damage equal
        to the hit points required for the spell, which you can draw as part of
        casting the spell (no additional action required). These hit points must
        come from you, unless you have features or feats that allow you to use
        other sources of blood to power your magic.</p><p>If you cast a blood
        magic spell with a higher-level spell slot, the minimum hit point cost
        increases to the slot level used.</p><p>You cannot use blood magic if
        doing so would reduce you to 0 hit
        points.</p><fieldset><legend><strong>Foundry
        Note</strong></legend><p>This is represented by adding
        <code>attributes.hp.value</code> to the consumption field and adding
        scaling.</p></fieldset><h3>Blood Damage</h3><p>Damage taken from casting
        blood magic reduces your current hit points and bypasses any temporary
        hit points or damage reduction you have (as you need blood to power the
        spell).</p><h3>Concentration</h3><p>Many blood magic spells lack the
        concentration requirements of normal spells. This is intentional, and
        part of what makes them appealing options for unscrupulous casters.
        Blood mages often take small amounts of damage when casting their
        spells, which might break their concentration—so it's important for them
        to have good options available that don't require concentration.</p>
